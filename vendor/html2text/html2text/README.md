## History

This library started life on the blog of Jon Abernathy http://www.chuggnutt.com/html2text

A number of projects picked up the lib and started using it - among those was RoundCube mail. They made a number of updates to it over time to suit their webmail client.

Now it has been extracted from RoundCube as a standalone lib. Hopefully it can be of use to others.
