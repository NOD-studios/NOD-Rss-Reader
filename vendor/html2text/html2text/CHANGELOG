Orignal class.html2text.inc credts and changelog:
=================================================

Thanks to Alexander Krug (http://www.krugar.de/) to pointing out and
correcting an error in the regexp search array. Fixed 7/30/03.

Updated set_html() function's file reading mechanism, 9/25/03.

Thanks to Joss Sanglier (http://www.dancingbear.co.uk/) for adding
several more HTML entity codes to the $search and $replace arrays.
Updated 11/7/03.

Thanks to Darius Kasperavicius (http://www.dar.dar.lt/) for
suggesting the addition of $allowed_tags and its supporting function
(which I slightly modified). Updated 3/12/04.

Thanks to Justin Dearing for pointing out that a replacement for the
<TH> tag was missing, and suggesting an appropriate fix.
Updated 8/25/04.

Thanks to Mathieu Collas (http://www.myefarm.com/) for finding a
display/formatting bug in the _build_link_list() function: email
readers would show the left bracket and number ("[1") as part of the
rendered email address.
Updated 12/16/04.

Thanks to Wojciech Bajon (http://histeria.pl/) for submitting code
to handle relative links, which I hadn't considered. I modified his
code a bit to handle normal HTTP links and MAILTO links. Also for
suggesting three additional HTML entity codes to search for.
Updated 03/02/05.

Thanks to Jacob Chandler for pointing out another link condition
for the _build_link_list() function: "https".
Updated 04/06/05.

Thanks to Marc Bertrand (http://www.dresdensky.com/) for
suggesting a revision to the word wrapping functionality; if you
specify a $width of 0 or less, word wrapping will be ignored.
Updated 11/02/06.

*** Big housecleaning updates below:

Thanks to Colin Brown (http://www.sparkdriver.co.uk/) for
suggesting the fix to handle </li> and blank lines (whitespace).
Christian Basedau (http://www.movetheweb.de/) also suggested the
blank lines fix.

Special thanks to Marcus Bointon (http://www.synchromedia.co.uk/),
Christian Basedau, Norbert Laposa (http://ln5.co.uk/),
Bas van de Weijer, and Marijn van Butselaar
for pointing out my glaring error in the <th> handling. Marcus also
supplied a host of fixes.

Thanks to Jeffrey Silverman (http://www.newtnotes.com/) for pointing
out that extra spaces should be compressed--a problem addressed with
Marcus Bointon's fixes but that I had not yet incorporated.

Thanks to Daniel Schledermann (http://www.typoconsult.dk/) for
suggesting a valuable fix with <a> tag handling.

Thanks to Wojciech Bajon (again!) for suggesting fixes and additions,
including the <a> tag handling that Daniel Schledermann pointed
out but that I had not yet incorporated. I haven't (yet)
incorporated all of Wojciech's changes, though I may at some
future time.
